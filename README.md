# Silent-Auction
Project Overview:-
The Silent Auction program is a Python-based tool that simulates a silent auction. Participants can place their bids for an item without knowing others' bids. At the end of the auction, the program determines and announces the highest bidder. This project is a great way to practice Python basics like loops, dictionaries, and input handling.

Features:-
Bid Entry: Allows multiple participants to place bids.
Privacy: Hides the bids of other participants during the auction.
Automatic Winner Selection: Identifies the highest bidder at the end.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple prompts for entering names and bids.
